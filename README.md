a program i made that applies a kernel convolution to a ppm image (ppm version 3 only)
left click or right click the kernel buttons to increase or decrease the values
when your done applying the kernel convolution to the image by pressing the equal button (=) the results will be seen.
press the save button to save the final image to the output folder (i recommend using gimp to open the ppm format images)
